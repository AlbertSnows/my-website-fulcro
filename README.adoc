== Docker Setup

todo...

=== Random Notes
docker file runs a micro vm to platform your build
deps -> dependency management
shadow-cljs -> frontend build


nrepl setup

example:
:nrepl {:main-opts ["-m" "nrepl.cmdline"
                      "-b" "0.0.0.0"
                      "-p" "9001"
                      "--middleware" "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]"]
          :extra-deps {nrepl/nrepl                 {:mvn/version,"0.9.0"}
                       cider/cider-nrepl           {:mvn/version,"0.28.5"}}}
